This module is divided into two main focuses. The first focus is a demonstration of mapdeck's capabilities, including drawing arcs, lines, text, and others; as well as the package's customizability. The second focus will be an application on a large real-life dataset to show how this package may be applied to open access data.  


The first focus will be demonstrated via the longest_flights.R code. The second focus will be demonstrated via the yyz_fra.R code.  

To run the longest_flights.R code:  
1. Download, save, and open longest_flights.R in R Studio  
2. Download airports.csv and Longest_flights.csv into the same folder as longest_flights  
3. Acquire a valid map token from mapbox.com  
4. Use that map token as the "key" variable in longest_flights.R  
5. Run longest_flights.R  
6. Under the "Viewer" tab in the right hand side of the window, click on the "show in new window" icon  
7. The map should be displayed on your broswer  

To run the yyz_fra.R code:  
1. Download and save yyz_fra.R, all_airports.csv, openflights-export-2019-11-19.csv, and fra.csv.  
2. Open yyz_fra.R and Run. Same instructions apply for running mapdeck.  
3. Read the comments. There can be multiple variations of the maps run - you can just run specific chunks of code to get separate results.
